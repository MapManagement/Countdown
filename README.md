# Countdown
Countdown will be an application that will only show a timer running down until a specific datetime is
reached. You simply just open the app and set a datetime. The chosen datetime is the end of the timer
and after confirming the datetime the timer will start counting down. You will now see the left years,
monhts, days, hours, minutes and seconds till the datetime is reached. When reaching this datetime
you will get a notification on your phone.
